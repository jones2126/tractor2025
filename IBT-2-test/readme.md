\section*{First Reading: 1 Kings 17:17--24 (NABRE)}
\textbf{Summary:} Elijah revives the dead son of the Widow of Zarephath, demonstrating that the living God alone holds power over life and death.

\textbf{Context:} 
Zarephath (modern Sarafand, Lebanon) lay in Phoenician—i.e., pagan—territory. By this miracle Elijah not only repays the woman’s hospitality but also vindicates Israel’s God against Baal, the local fertility deity presumed impotent to grant life. The scene prefigures both the prophetic sign and the Eucharistic themes of Sunday’s Gospel.

\section*{Responsorial Psalm: Ps 30:2, 4, 5-6, 11-12, 13}
\textit{Response:} “I will praise you, Lord, for you have rescued me.”\\
A song of thanksgiving originally tied to Temple dedication (cf.\ 2 Chr 7). The psalmist moves from lament to praise, mirroring the widow’s sorrow turned to joy after Elijah’s miracle.

\section*{Second Reading: Galatians 1:11--19}
\textbf{Summary:} Paul defends his apostolic authority as a direct revelation from Christ, stressing that the Gospel he preaches is not of human origin.

\textbf{Context:} Written c.\ AD 48--55 to churches Paul had never visited, the letter counters Judaizing agitators who claimed Paul’s gospel was second-hand. Paul’s “Arabia” sojourn (v.\ 17) likely places him in the Nabatean kingdom, a theological retreat before returning to Damascus and then his first Jerusalem visit three years later.

\section*{Gospel: Luke 7:11--17}
\textbf{Summary:} Jesus halts a funeral procession in Nain, raises a widow’s only son, and returns him to his mother. The crowd acclaims Jesus as “a great prophet” and God visits His people.

\textbf{Context:} Nain sits seven miles southeast of Nazareth; its very name means “pleasant” or “charming.” The miracle is unique to Luke and forms a deliberate parallel to Elijah’s action: two widows, two dead sons, two resurrections. Jesus’ compassion (splagchnizomai, v.\ 13) carries sacrificial overtones that reach their climax in Luke’s later narrative of the Passion. The people’s reaction (“God has visited,” v.\ 16) echoes Zechariah’s Benedictus (Lk 1:68) and sets the stage for the Church’s proclamation that in Christ’s resurrection, divine visitation is definitive.

\textbf{For Prayer \& Reflection}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Both Elijah and Jesus restore life in foreign or marginal settings—God’s mercy knows borders.
\item Paul’s insistence on divine origin of the Gospel invites us to test every “new” teaching against the apostolic witness.
\item The widow’s lament (Ps 30) and Jesus’ tenderness teach us to bring every sorrow to the One who “gives life to the dead” (Rom 4:17).
\end{itemize}
